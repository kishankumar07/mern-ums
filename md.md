How Hanuman realised about his extraordinary powers in the epic ramayana

Hopefully it might be the headline that got your attention here ! Well let me save that for later till then, allow me to announce that "I have been selected as the best coordinator from our batch BCR 47/48 during the month of August 2024." The remarkable fact is that this is the second time I got the same entitlement once again after April 2024, while I was at Brototype's Calicut Kinfra hub.

This content would be a bit lengthy as I am excited to share how I nailed both of them on a single shot and I'll try not to make the content tedious for you and will use simple English.


There exists some criterias for selecting the best coordinator of the month and they are well structured with bullet points, and he/she is in charge of the whole batch should stick on to those rules and should plan smartly to not get messed up with their tech life also.

Thanks to my co coordinator Safana, who was always supporting me even at situations I was down. We worked together as a team to bring out better outcomes from our batch. 

So what were the strategies followed ? 

If I was asked about those implementations we brought up, the simple answer is "We haven't implemented anything new , what we did was just fixing the existing issues that was found among our batch mates, they are good at handling English decently, so active at sessions and so on but at some part there some of the issues spotted was : "Not attending the session on time / leaving the session early without informing" and the second : "not sending the audio task before 10pm as instructed by our communication trainers.

We coordinators have planned to first fix all these issues first before implementing anything new and what we thought was like "is there any use in increasing the force of water coming out of pipe without fixing its leakage at first ? " And it is really challenging to implement everything successfully in a remote batch while compared to hub,as everyone scattered everywhere around the globe with varying time zone.

These were our strategies: 
1) First know the likes and dislikes of all our students,what interest them more.
